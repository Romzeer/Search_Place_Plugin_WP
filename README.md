# Search_Place_Plugin_WP

Hello there, I developped a plugin for searching places by keywords (ex : pizza) near of your positions.

# Explications

It's using the GoogleMAP Javascript API of Google for open the places on a map. And for getting your position directly on your web browser, I use the API geolocalisation from Mozilla Developers.
And when you fuse the two API, you can get the latitude and longitude directly for using the Google Map API.
And i choose to install it as a widget on Wordpress, because it's more easy to activate and for UX design.

# Prerequisites

You need Wordpress, and active Javascript on your Web Browser

# Install

Juste clone the repository or download the zip files. And put the files on the plugins directory of your Wordpress Installation
Then activate the plugins on wordpress : Admin > Extensions > Install extensions > Active "Place Search"

Then you need to active the widget : Appearance > Widgets > Active the Place Search Widget and choose a title

And it's work !
